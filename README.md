Ping-Pong Game
Overview

The Ping-Pong Game is a classic arcade-style game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. This project showcases my ability to implement real-time game mechanics and create engaging user experiences with fundamental programming concepts.
Features

    Interactive Gameplay: Players control paddles to hit the ball back and forth, aiming to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.
    Dynamic Mechanics: The game includes dynamic paddle and ball mechanics with smooth, real-time motion and collision detection.
    Scoring System: Real-time scoring system that updates the score for each player whenever the ball passes a paddle.
    User Interface: Simple and intuitive graphical interface with clear visual effects and controls.

Technologies

    Python: Programming language used to develop the game logic and mechanics.
    Turtle Graphics: Python library used for creating the graphical elements and handling real-time drawing and user interactions.

Gameplay

    Controls: Players use keyboard inputs to control the movement of their paddles.
    Collision Detection: Real-time collision detection between the ball and the paddles, as well as the ball and the game borders.
    Game Loop: Continuously running game loop that handles game state updates, rendering, and user input.

Installation

To run the Ping-Pong Game locally, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Download or clone the repository and execute the pingpong_game.py file.
